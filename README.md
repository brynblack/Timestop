# Timestop
A Minecraft Datapack used to stop time.

Timestop is a datapack made for just specifically, stopping time and motion. No extra functions, or models. Just the main components. Thanks to this as well, the datapack is incredibly tiny, a little bit over 5kb, perfect for computers that struggle regarding performance. It is also heavily optimised, using a combination of small functions, arbitrary sorting, and clean code, so don't be afraid to use if you have a slow device.
